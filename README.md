# Predicting-Product-Category-from-Text-Data
This repository contains the the data analysis done for the final project of the Modelling in the Tidyverse course  It contains analysis such as data preprocessing, fitting statistical models, computing summary statistics, or creating plots.

The files were too large for GitHub, so I uploaded it to my Google drive. You can access the files [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1WRanJg8HaoZkJH68z7OHN0p89cItVSqS?usp=sharing)
